## What I Built
I built a simple <strong>To-Do</strong> App that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. The app performs <strong>CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations </strong> using <strong>Hive</strong>, a lightweight and fast NoSQL database for Flutter.

### Installation & Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zelvann/todo-app.git
cd todo-app
```
Then install dependencies, 
```bash
flutter pub get
```
After that, run the app
```bash
flutter run
```

### Usage
- Click the + button to <strong>add</strong> a new task.
- Tap a task to <strong>edit</strong> it.
- Swipe left/right to <strong>delete</strong> a task.
